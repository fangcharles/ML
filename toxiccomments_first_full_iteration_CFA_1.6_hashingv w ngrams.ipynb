I'm very happy that Spring is here and the weather is turning nice again.  If you have particularly buildings, let me know.  Otherwise, I'm working on some non-Wiki projects.  I recently sent out messages on Facebook and MySpace, and via e-mail, that I was no longer doing any large-scale Wiki projects.  These were mistaken as retirement notices, but in reality it's just that I have shifted my creative focus to other areas.  The last round of Film photos were my swan song, to so to speak.  I still have a lot of material to upload, some interviews to publish, and an article to write (Arthur Kramer (attorney)).  Glad you are here!  David '''''' \"\n",

      "\n",
      "I've discovered that not only fractional iteration is possible, but also complex iteration. It's not as intuitive as fractional iteration, but it does make sense once you have a new model for what iteration means. Probably the simplest explanation is with orbitals in the complex plain: iterating to a real values generates the complex orbitals as paths. Iterating to imaginary powers, meanwhile, generates paths perpendicular to the orbitals at every point. You need the entire vector field of orbitals to know the new path. For example, iterating a linear function (multiplying by a constant) creates orbitals which are rays. Iterating to imaginary powers creates paths with are concentric circles. After that, complex iteration can be done by composing real and imaginary values. For a more precise derivation, I had to invent a new type of derivative, it looks at the instantaneous change in value at a point as the function iterates. The formula for this derivative is: \n",
      "f*(x) = lim n->0 (fn(x) - x)/n\n",
      "Which is equivalent to the derivative of f's Abel function. The key about this derivative is it has the property that fn* = f x n . This enables iteration to imaginary powers to be calculated directly. Ultimately I think it is equivalent to taking the analytic extension of the Abel function, but it's a bit more intuitive than Taylor series witchcraft. I've done the calculations to arrive at Euler's identity using this method rather than the typical one, and graphically it makes much more sense: once it's understood how complex iteration works, it's just geometry to find the imaginary value e must be raised to in order to complete the arc from 1 to -1.\n",

Because she already earned a quota in the air pistol, the Olympic slot has been distributed to the runner-up Sandra Uptagrafft of the United States. Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country, as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event.

Because Brazil has reserved a place in each of the nine events, and he competes for the host nation, this does not imply that the quota has been distributed to Dion. As per rules on the host country places, these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation, if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period. With Rippel's victory at the Pan American Games, the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. If he is confirmed by NOC to compete for the Olympics as long as he obtains the MQS (minimum qualifying score), then the unused host country place will be reallocated to the NOC with the highest MQS that has not yet obtained a quota place or been granted a Tripartite Invitation for the Games.\n",

      "Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a \"\"myth\"\" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than \"\"anti-Serb sentiment\"\" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to \"\"welcoming of independence\"\" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment. You're not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavy-handed 1990s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall. That said, Savich and Trifkovic are fine sources, people just don't like them because their ethnicity so-called \"\"overrules\"\" their wisdom.   \"\n",

The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil.

Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that.

It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are \"\"unencyclopedic\"\", frankly you couldn't be more wrong.

      "Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.\n",

      "\n",
      "Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that \"\"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions\"\". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as \"\"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines\"\". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows \"\"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions\"\". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that \"\"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions\"\". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads \"\"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy\"\". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of \"\"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems...\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to \"\"making claims\"\" or worse, \"\"stating beliefs\"\". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.\n",

      "(1) Might it be useful to \"\"update\"\" Wittgenstein's contributions to various academic and philosophical inquiries? It seems that Wittgenstein's use of language games and place of language in experience has experienced something of a revival among some postmodern academics. \n",

      "I'm no Wittgenstein expert (just stumbled upon this interesting, if frustrating, discussion) and any credentials I might have had to the \"\"philosopher's club\"\" have probably long expired, but a part of my doctoral work did float in and around meaning, words, classification and the uses we make of themvia semiotics. Thus I am eminently unqualified to write such a piece, though I can see a hole on the bookshelf where something like it might just fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is, philosophy did not end with Adorno, or even with Habermas. Some young buck out there, can you tell whether this connection (Wittgenstein's work on language and postmodern approaches to community-as-language) has developed at all in contemporary (21st century) philosophical work? \n",

      "it might be difficult to come up with primary source material that would either confirm or deny even positions held forth in academic lectures but unpublished, let alone personal eccentricities (after all, if the people writing about these eccentricities were themselves brilliant, their own opinions of normalcy should be correspondingly suspect, see the \"\"it takes one to know one\"\" argument)\n",

Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists.

The newsreporting to me sounds kind of biased in making it seem like the deck was stacked against Bell in that regard when in truth in a community that small it would have been almost impossible not to draw some connection within 1 or 2 degrees of seperation. I honestly do believe some of the events were biased against Bell (particularly charging him as an adult when the law clearly said that could not be done and the releveant factors the DA considered weren't considered relevant in prior LA SC decisions), but I think their is a reason you're not seeing that fact harped on... even the pro-Bell supporters realise it's probably more fluke then noteworthy. It just looks to me like people trying to make a statistic look like a fact, when if you put it into a broader picture, it's nothing signifigant. I'd wager on most jurys in the Parish, white or black criminal, one of the jurors can be traced in some way back to the victim, and I doubt at MOST you'd need even a 3 people seperation to link it.

      "I think the issue of whether someone is extremely famous or not will invoke investigation of two issues. One is the issue of perspective and who makes the judgement call and the second issue is one of values and how we, as impartial observers, value different aspects of life in general. Third, and very likely the most important issue, is how society values them? Peale is currently in the Alumni section and I think it is only fair to keep it that way. It might be interesting to pose for discussion whether his contributions in the spiritual world are more important than other people's contributions in the worlds of science, politics, education and so on. This, without a doubt, will generate an unambigously political discussion and a very controversial one as well. If you are a deeply religious person, you might say that religion is very important. On the other hand, if you are a humanist, you very likely will disagree. Most people will opt for the middle ground on placing a judgement call. I think focusing on his work without redundant characterizations will reduce debate on the controversial topic of religion and its importance of life.\n",

I am not a royalist by heart but I am by head. There is great value when there is a non political Head of State and her having many hats as it were has greatly benefited (IMHO) all her realms. The Queen has been faultless as far as I am aware in handling this juggling act. And part of the reason for that is because she does take her other roles very seriously. Apparently it sometimes annoys UK Prime Ministers when she swaps hats and speaks to them on behalf of some country other than the UK. They get an unfair advantage in that sense because the Queen meets with the UK Prime Minsister weekly. In practical matters the legal situation is very clear and the Queen takes her various roles very seriously indeed. To suppose otherwise is pure devilment.\n",

I think it’s important to make the distinction in all areas and I believe that by doing this, it would prevent people from simply naming him cofounder without have looking at the full story. I think wikipedia has the responsibility as the primary source of quick information to make sure its got the correct story in all places. To paraphrase the above user box..

In general, we have tried to use registration as the bar for notability for political parties. In some cases such as Palmer United, this has been waived - PUP got major, nationwide coverage for months before it was registered, and also had two Queensland state MPs within its ranks very quickly. Should the new Country Party (which is, I should add, extraordinarily unlikely to achieve registration under its current name) receive that kind of coverage, or get some defectors in its ranks, then we might make an exception for it too. In the meantime, this is simply a case of WP:TOOSOON. I know from a long time covering politics here that very many of these kinds of parties fade away quickly without ever doing anything much; I'm not saying that will happen here, but given this party is less than a month old I think it's too soon to be including it.

Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'.

In 3D sweet-parker or petcheck reconnection effectively becomes 3D null-point reconnection (without getting into quai-separatrix layers versus true separatricies). In addition, the application to the Magnetosphere is very different than the application to the solar corona, in that magnetospheric reconnection topologically requires a 4-flux system, whereas the solar corona requires only a 2-flux system.\n",

Formally, magnetic reconnection is the tearing mode, of resistive MHD instability theory (see Furth, H.P., Killeen, J., and Rosenbluth, M. N., 1963, Phys. of Fluids, 6, 459). Several researches have shown line-tying the system simply slows the (linear) tearing mode growth rate (see Velli, M. and Hood, A. W., 1989, Sol Phys 119, 107; Velli, M., Einaudi, G., and Hood, A.

      "Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.\n",

      "Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song \"\"And They Call the Wind Maria\"\", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.\n",

      "1990–1992: Early commercial success\n",
      "Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990.

In Wiki we have to rewrite the article to reflect this reality. If you read the Kerala and Malayalam entries, and www.kerlahistory.com site this new idea is brought out. Hence Kerala and Tamil Nadu are hitched at the hips up-until the 10 century regarding their cultural development. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caste itself is not a proper word to describe the social condition of South Asia. What is more accurate is Jati and Varna.  According to linguists like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were societal cleavage based on certain lineages that were slowly cornering certain economic productive mechanisms such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, bards etc. This was in response to a move away from hunter gatherers to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle herding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of flux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this milieu the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins  did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus  Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhism were  very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires. \n",

      "The word Pulaiti and Pulayan are used in Sangam literature to describe people serving chiefs. They were attached to the wealthy because apparently they were dispossessed or had nothing to independably live on. The name of the Kannadiga caste is Holeya. Where Hole in archaic Kannada means menstrual blood thus indicating that even before Tamil and Kannada became independent certain lineages may have become debased. As you know that’s a long time ago:)) \n",
      "\n",
      "Why is ancient Tamilakam important as opposed to rest of India to understand the unique caste system. Because it was the last frontier to succumb to Indo Aryan population and cultural advance into South Asia. Further it maintained its cultural independence just enough to record (via the Sangam literature) the prevailing conditions before culturally becoming part of rest of India after the Bhakthi period. Today so called separate Keralite and Tamil cultures are just another appendages of a greater Indian culture with minor regional variations.\n",

Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function.

The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier\"\" or 'feeble and unintelligible\"\" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.\n",

When so many founders of the organizations walk out it is significant; recognizing Leinster House was a watershed.

As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "These paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.\n",

      "Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "This incident played a key roll in causing Stallman to spin out of the AI & Lisp field and to tackle creating a public domain copy of Unix.  Gifted as he is, my colleagues and I feel it is useful for people to know what motivated Stallman’s change in course of action and to get a sense of how opposed he was and may still be to conventional business and business law.\n",

Hmm i loved Jack & Sharon together in the start. They were amazing, i love Shack and I hope someday they could get another chance, how are they awful? Better then Nick/PhyHO. I've seen every episode of Sharon's for AGES, and out of all these years, the only time i have questioned her is when she went to New Orleans and slept with Adam..ugh that ruined all my Shick fantasies, Ha! I feel so bad for her, at first i was like YAY Victor/Sharon are getting married maybe he really loves her..but then i realized it wasn't for love but for revenge. And WTF is with her & Tucker? NO. Just ...NO. They would not make a good romance. I want Sharon to be single or with Nick. That's it for me lmaoo. I don't really care about Jill anymore tbh. I'm very picky, which is why I don't watch full episodes anymore from SOAPS (other then DOOL, i can enjoy the whole episode of that). OMG i love Sharon Case!!

Likewise, a computer is assigned a unique IP address which let's any other computer to connect directly to it by using their unique IP address.

I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede.

Yet, it is also likely to be used few times in an article; however, I was thinking \"\"maxnum/5\"\" for a pure quick numerical maximum. I have not seen much improvement from Lua speed, and of course, the extra {#invoke:} accessor templates will irritate people. Meanwhile, we have millions of templates, such as 100,000+ infoboxes. So, I think we just need more basic template parser functions, such as {#length:string}, {#numeric: data}, and yes, {#set:val|70*5} to set parameter values mid-stream (like a \"\"real\"\" language), rather than calling another template to pass val=70*5. As for the expansion depth, experienced programmers are more likely to exceed the limit, due to typical if-else-if-else-if-else logic, and bottom-line, the 40-limit expansion is just way too low for modern computers, which use perhaps, 200 if-else nesting, easily, where perhaps a limit of 60 would solve most problems now.

The caduceus, two serpents intertwined on a winged staff, was carried by Mercury, the god of commerce. Shortly after the surgeon general announced the caduceus as the medical symbol, critics said it was not appropriate, even though the caduceus had been used intermittently as various US Army insignia, starting with the chevrons for hospital stewards in 1851. The debate was important because it was apparent to all of the officers that the insignia was to become the device for the expanding Medical Department. The critics were unhappy with the caduceus as the medical insignia, and they stated that the single serpent looped about a staff was properly associated with Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The Army and Navy Register of 28 June 1902 noted the argument about the appropriate insignia. Giving the badge an unusual interpretation, the editor wrote of the caduceus: \"\"The rod represents power, the serpents stand for wisdom and the two wings imply dilligence and activity, qualities which are undoubtedly possessed by our Medical officers. The design, however, does not lend itself easily to a Corps emblem.\"\" The dispute over the appropriateness of a caduceus continued for many years but never flared into a raging controversy.\n",

It is the largest circulating newspaper in the area. The Valley Press covers the fast growing Antelope Valley - especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance.\n",

      "The Valley Press was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915 as the Palmdale Post. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 1, 1958, four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families. Arthur F. Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958, with Ralph and his brother Maurice W. Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr. as secretary-treasurer. Ralph H. Markham bought out Maurice W. Markham, and Lamont Odett Sr. bought out Arthur F. Folz on April 1, 1961, to create the partnership of Ralph H. Markham and Lamont Odett Sr. In October 1975, Lamont Odett Sr. died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr. became co-publishers. On March 1, 1981, William C. Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director. William C. Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H. Markham's death in November 1985.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Markham family became sole owners of the Antelope Valley Press in January 1994. William C. Markham is president and publisher. The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont (\"\"Monty\"\") Odett Sr. running the day to day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun (Now The Yuma Sun) with William's new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma, Arizona. When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935, the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley and later to Palmdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper later dropped the \"\"South\"\" from its nameplate, and became simply the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s. It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted. The Tuesday edition was added in 1969, followed by Friday (1982) and Wednesday (1988), Saturday (1992) and finally the Monday edition in 1998, making the Antelope Valley Press a full-fledged daily newspaper - perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery. The paper remains in family hands, and has never been corporately owned or had nonlocal ownership.\n",
      "Technology and editorial outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "The Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peach-colored newsprint while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system. The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements. That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment. Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system. The classified system was upgraded in early 2005 and the editorial system will be upgraded by year's end.\n",

It does, though, have \"\"enabling frameworks\"\" with a named UK governmental group. The nature of an enabling framework is not specified. Perhaps it just means financial connections?

      "The Working it out Tour started in 2010 with Traci K Shoop taking it to the next level of fitness.  By adding music with muscle and modeling.  She presented herself through the east coast and some west promoting health and music.  Presented in part for association FPLA to raise money  helping with her in transition and team artists and athletes become members to showcase to be promoted.  Traci's music was a hit on her teaser song Kiss me love me...with holiday added starting in December featuring her very first christmas album \"\" Tis the Season to be Sexy\"\".  This album earned her credentials for a peoples choice nomination where voted amongst some of the top pop artists like Susan Doyle and Mariah Carey.  In this tour she went around presenting a way to help with hard times by giving back to support her coming back out from supporting the troops.  It landed her even top awards with Karaoke social networks. When making the top charts in with her \"\" Be My Santa BAby\"\" it inspired her to bring out for the tour for kisses with the United States Entertainment organization with the service members.  With allowing her to get a chance to mission to meet and greet soldiers during the war time to give morale and become a long distance pen pal.  She herself committed 14 years as a spouse and served under contract training soldiers and families during the times when most effected by stress and abandonment.  Traci's goal as an artist and pro athlete was to bring as many people on the team to help with promoting them during transitional times asking other non service artists who were working to try and contribute financially or through contributions.  But to also honor the ones who like her served not under combat but through missions and it earned her loyality pin, coins and awards with national congressional committes. Where she placed on the board. The true inspiration to push to try and break from the low income of serving and being honored and recognized truly with demanding to be heard.  This tour was of course a struggle with many of the financial reasons and not allowing to spread the truth of what really goes on and how it effects families.  The way some are not truly appreciated on both ends when helping while others in the entertainment receive huge amounts of money and media exposure with little to ever be left for the ones who also work for their freedom.

      "Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name \"\"Wikipedia\"\" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning \"\"quick\"\") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. \n",
      "I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?\n",

You are right in suggesting the article Kurdistan as a good model, as it has avoided all sorts of attacks by those who suggest that it infringes the sovereignty of other nations.

Please see also Sensei Shukumine's personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno. Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website: Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu - 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine. Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996. 212.127.137.2 19:37, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)\n",

And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain, Denmark, Holland, and Japan. I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event.

      "But by the way, did you know that Mr. Tosa received several letters all over the world, just after Mr. Shukumine died? Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo's could join the organization of Mr. Tosa. Mr. Tosa denied these people to join his organization.\n",
      "There was one person who send such a letter to Mr. Tosa from Holland, and you may guess who.\n",

      "No, I didn't know that Mr. Tosa received several letters from all over the world. I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland. I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book \"\"Shin Karatedo Kyohan\"\" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year (Jan. 2005). Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine, as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.\n",

I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it.  An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic.  I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative.  Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?

      "\n",
      "1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\"\n",
      "http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their \"\"Nationalist\"\" and \"\"New Nation\"\" magazines, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association\"\" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book \"\"Looking Backward\"\" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  \n",
      "\n",
      "After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, and he preached what he called \"\"military socialism.\"\"  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the \"\"Wholecaust\"\" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'\n",

      "I'm concerned about the references to the \"\"Most Haunted\"\" show in the Cultural References section. First of all, the host of the show was Yvette Fielding, not Derek Acorah - he was one of the resident \"\"psychics\"\". Secondly, it says that Derek Acorah was \"\"possessed\"\" during the programme. Although \"\"possessed\"\" is in inverted commas, I think it would be more accurate to say that he \"\"appeared to be possessed\"\". Acorah was supposedly \"\"possessed\"\" by some \"\"spirit\"\" every week and in fact, he was later dropped from the Most Haunted shows after the team became convinced he was making things up from bits of information he overheard during filming. Thirdly, some of the audience say they see \"\"dark beings\"\" and other such things on the webcams every week - not just in this programme. I think it really would be better to limit the Most haunted reference to the fact that it was the most watched programme on television that night, as the rest of it is unsubstantiated speculation that trivialises the subject.   \"\n",

      "User:Lordradish asked a question about my possible conflict of interest - WP:COI.  First, always look at Wikipedia policies if you think there is an issue, don't just go away angry. I know that I'm still learning Wikipedia policies and just reading the above I can see that in 2007-2008 period I was somewhat confused about a couple of them. The longer you are here, the more sensitive you become to all of them through experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Re: COI questions, usually its better to start that on a talk page per WP: \"\"The first approach should be direct discussion of the issue with the editor, referring to this guideline.\"\" Actually, I thought this issue explicitly had been dealt with here before, but reading through I see I evidently confused it with a related COI question elsewhere. Anyway, I'll respond in interest of full disclosure, outline questions I think have to be asked on the talk page of any editor here who gives any indication of being familiar with the issue, and suggest some possible ways of dealing with WP:COI issues here.\n",
      "\n",
      "My possible WP:COI\n",
      "To answer Lordradish's question, I have contributed 43 blog entries to the secessionist blog Vermont Commons over the last 38 months. I have not been paid.  My blog entries have been more generally related to the topic of secession and occasionally make passing references to Vermont and its secession issues, including in comments on others' entries. I don’t live in Vermont and don't intend to. I don't consider myself a member of any Vermont Secession group. As far as I remember, I only have corresponded with the Vermont Commons editor, and that by email. I get some irregular Vermont Commons email and mailings and occasional Second Vermont Republic snail mails. \n",
      "I also have suffered a couple years of vicious and even libelous off wiki attacks from the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot, including because I edited this page, and including at another blogspot page he set up just to ridicule me with incredible sexist ire. Therefore I have come to know far more about what types of individuals may be making very POV and COI edits to this article than I would have otherwise.\n",

They are strongly motivated to trash or downplay the significance of Second Vermont Republic and don't care much about Wikipedia policies.  Therefore here are some questions that might have to be asked on such suspected persons' talk pages (or here, but guidance on that appreciated). And I hope it’s ok to outline these general questions given the track record of this particular article.\n",
      "\n",
      "General questions include: are you the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot.com which, while using some information from reliable sources, has a track record of unrelenting nasty, exaggerated and unprofessional attacks on individuals, often with little or even contrary evidence presented; is that person a close personal associate?; do you work for or with that person in some other capacity, such as at a publication or a blog or a sometimes paid campaign staffer?; are you a Democratic or Republican Party activist or contractor or potential contractor who fears that secession candidates running in 2012 might take votes away from Democratic Party candidates and throw the election to a Republican. (According to official returns the candidate Pete Garritano mentioned in th is article got 3.7% of the returns, something not yet in the article.)  Depending on whether a candidate was a more right or left winging secessionist, such a 2012 candidate could away enough votes to sway an election to the opponent of someone support by the editor.\n",

The point is that we cannot prove that the editors who used the sources showing in google books search results only saw and used the snippet view.  If we are to assume good faith here, we should believe they did actually see the full texts, cited them, and provided the links to google books as the best available online target (it's better to have a link to a snippet view rathen than to nothing at all, wouldn't you agree?).  However, this does not mean you or anyone else cannot ever question the validity of these cites—what it does mean is that to be able to question them you'll have to have something better than logically-enhanced mind wanderings (such as one above).  Which brings me back to my original recommendation—find the books, read them, and if they indeed are not acceptable as references, remove the sentences in question.  If, in turn, anyone questions the results of your analysis, well, they'll have to get their own copy of the books on their own, after which you can go through the pleasure of discussing both sides' interpretations of the sources on the article's talk page, instead of accusing the other party of what may or may not have been the case of OR/SYN/plain negligence to do a proper research...— • (yo?); 17:31, March 30, 2009 (UTC)\n",

The trial, which has received extensive cover in the media, deals with issues for which BP has already pleaded guilty, and faces fine of up to $20 billion. The presence of other articles is immaterial. This is a very serious trial, and it behooves us to mention it to readers, and state what is at stake.

      "Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence \"\"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases\"\"  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    \"\n",

The problem is that the quote does not tell us what Hitler said when asked about the killings, it tells us only what Henriette von Schirach claimed that Hitler said when asked about them.

      "No,  and [ŋ'] are the same sound, and in phonetics no one uses [ŋ']. My point is that in the system used here, an fheall is transcribed with  (= conventional [n']) or  (= conventional [N']), while a ngeall is transcribed with  (= conventional [ŋ']), just as geall is transcribed with  (= conventional [g']), gheall with [j] or  (= conventional , ceann with [c] (= conventional [k']), and cheann with [ç] (= conventional [x']). Basically, the entire palatal series of IPA is used for the Irish \"\"slender velars\"\"; the article uses  rather than  for conventional [L'] for precisely this reason. I don't know whether /x/ is velar or uvular for most speakers, but I do know that all the sources I checked call it velar, so that's what the article says. Wikipedia has to reflect what's been published, not what readers and editors know in our hearts (and ears) to be true; cf. Wikipedia:Verifiability. Of course you have to define how you use your symbols, and I believe this article does, but for the sake of consistency with other phonology articles at Wikipedia, this article sticks to symbols that are official parts of the IPA. I do think there will be more readers familiar with IPA than with the traditional symbols of Irish philology, and for those readers who are more familiar with the latter, WP:IPA-ga, which is linked to at the top of this article, should clear up any confusion. —gr \"\n",

It was clear after reading through the entire history that something was definitely not right. Geoff is quite rightly furious and is taking every step possible to find the protagonists. He has asked for his account to be suspended until further notice as he does not want this sort of thing to be repeated. I was very curious as he normally keeps his involvement in Templary quite private. There are however a few people out there who he has exposed for fraudulent activity and who will do nothing to get back at him. I am also very upset and can understand if editors do not want me to help out. Geoff's advice is to not get involved if these sort of problems can occur. But I am fairly good at reference checking, spelling and grammar if you require any help. I will also understand if you feel that my premature support without checking a real identity is disbarment to future assistance. Whichever way I wish you the best with the article on a subject that we are all like to study and promote. Geoff has emailed me to also pass on his wishes to all concerned and hopes you will understand his personal wish not to get involved.

      "And even then I have very serious doubts about the accuracy of the results. Mc Carthy's method may give accurate AD dates, but I suspect there are problems. Take 763. He's content to put Domnall Midi's death in that year, just as the historians are, but why does AD 763 start with an event dated to 20 November? Fair enough, that could just be a glitch from the compilation, but it could also be that whatever the source was, its years did not start on 1 January or March 25 but instead on 1 September. Adding that to an article would be WP:OR, so we won't do that - we do when it's Bede's years because people have discussed it in print, but this they haven't - but we can take it into consideration here when deciding what to do. \n",

Even if Mc Carthy's system is perfect, you can only be entirely confident about the year if the event falls between 25 March and 31 August.\n",

If it were me, I'd go with \"\"historian\"\" dates, i.e. what Byrne, Charles-Edwards and the rest say, and add Mc Carthy's corrections in a footnote, which is what is done with Penda of Mercia and other C7th Anglo-Saxons where there is a similar, but smaller, problem.

I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about \"\"popular parlance\"\", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the \"\"popular parlance\"\" of much of the world, \"\"Great Britain\"\" and \"\"England\"\" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.\n",

Additionally, helicopters are a valuable asset to aviation, and assist in saving far more lives than fixed-winf aircraft ever can. Not only that, but the rotor-wing segment of Flight Simulation (introduced in 1998 when Microsoft forst released a helicopter simulation with the Bell JetRanger in Flight Simulator 98) has exploded, and is now one of the most popular components of Flight Simulation in general. Hovercontrol is a valued, and highly revered website that that has led the way in rotary flight dynamics improvements.

Perhaps another idea would be to say \"\"... the first to be founded as part of a university\"\" or something similar to that?

I recall there was a to-do about the Jefferson Society a while back and there was a question about whether their site was a sufficient source due to the notion that they have a conflict of interest in that they consider it prestigious to be the oldest debating society.

Overlooking the article, the same amount of emphasis is placed on his music career as it is placed on his personal life. Actually, somewhat less. I get the impression a relative of Nelson's has had a hand in writing this article. Perhaps a progeny who was directly involved in some of the court cases among the Nelsons and Harmons.

Orbison's life was nowhere near as vibrantly sexual as Ricky Nelson's (an impression that is really backed up in this article), so the biographer slipped in shocking tidbits about other artists, for some reason explaining that only parts of Patsy Cline were found after her airplane accident.

      "I will reply for Dreadstar, and he can respond  if he needs to. Let me first explain the concept of verifiability, which is a core pillar of Wikipedia. Another thing is notability, which basically means that you can create an acronym about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without citations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc.,), then articles are likely to be deleted. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additionally, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your username is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia's core policies. I'd encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed notability.

High Court website (which ought to meet reputable source /verificability criteria). For DOGSOC notability a simple google (is this verifiable?) news search on \"\"Nandigram\"\" should do.

      "In your answer, one notices very well that you still made an error, because you fix yourselves on the imaginary scientific value of Rognes or of the americains, by hating the objective value of the other authors and in particular of Lehrer.  To better explain you the taxonomic situation of the kind Bengalia s. str., I request from you do not consider that I insult certain characters of current taxonomy and to see reality exactly exposed by me. \n",
      "\n",
      "No author who occupied himself more or less tangentially with Bengaliidae, admits that Bengalia testacea  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  Only Rognes, which copied Sabrosky (1999:62), which knew this group of dipterous in same measurement as Rognes, wrote (with the collaboration of bibliographical and nonscientific impostors:  Neal L Evenhuis and F.C. Thompson) that this type is the nomen nudum  B. testacea  indicated by Duponchel (1842)(?!).  Thus, which makes N.L Evenhuis, J. E. O' Hara, T. Pape and A. C. Pont are only of copy and to transcribe exactly the silly things of Sabrosky, without any proof or analyze scientific.  Moreover, because these authors are good friends with Rognes, it also added \"\" Valid genus [ tests  Rognes (2006:467) ] \"\", but not validates species-type.  But, can you say which tests was made by Rognes?,  who knows nothing on Bengaliidae, which made the most stupid silly things in its work, which does not know the morphological terminology of their genitalia male, which mixes the drawings of the authors for the different species to make its new taxa, which makes the photography of the microscopic preparations of the species studied by Lehrer and deposited in the Natural history museum of London and which affirms that those are clean taxonomic imaginations?  Don't you believe my assertions?  Then I recommend to you to read, for a good documentation of your encyclopaedia, work of Lehrer of his review Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2008(18):1-4;  2010(23):1-22 and 22-25; 2010(24):20-24 and 24-30;  2010(25):1-4 and work:  LEHRER & WEI, 2010, a new Eastern kind of the family Bengaliidae (Diptera) - Bull.

      "Thus you can understand that Rognes is incomparable being unaware of, which wanted to make taxonomic \"\" revolutions \"\" with the language devoted to its handicapped pupils of the school of Stavanger (Norway) where it works and with the mystifications of literature and information.  Moreover, you can consider only the work of Evenhuis &Comp.;  of Zootaxa an authority in the taxonomy of Bengaliidae constitutes, because they never studied the species of the group and in particular ?, because all the authors, of Zumpt (1956) and until Lehrer (2010) consider that Bengalia labiata  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.

Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. \"\"Port Adelaide 138\"\" rather than the preferred format \"\"Port Adelaide 138\"\". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia.

      "User:JimWae, the part your assessment relevant to my compromise version, is for the most part, incorrect, and furthermore, you have acknowledged that you do not have references that support your claims. If you looked at the references that qualified the statement regarding the \"\"propagating atheism,\"\" you would find that it is a factual statement. And once again, this article is not about state atheism exclusively, but about the ideology of militant atheism, which was applied to some atheist states; an atheist state could exist, without promoting militant atheism. Your version of the introduction eliminates defining the ideology of militant atheism as given by several references and summarized in the Concepts section of the article; the lede should define the ideology and then talk about its Application, which parallels the structure of the article, namely the headings listed in the article's table of contents. Furthermore, contrary to your opinion, militant atheism is an integral part of Marxism-Leninism, as supported by the consequent references. For example, Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion, specifically states:  When discussing content, you must keep in mind WP:RS, rather than your original research. You assert that many people do not know about the Cultural Revolution and for this reason, it should be removed from the paragraph. That argument does not hold any water whatsoever, as this is an encylopædia. Moreover, removing the information on the concept of militant atheism, the Cultural Revolution, French Revolution, and political thinkers, violates WP:LEDE, which states \"\"The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article.\"\" Your revision of the introduction fails to do this. If the term \"\"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\"\" is not as common, however, I would not mind compromising and changing it to just \"\"Cultural Revolution.\"\" Rather than constructing a new version, I would consider suggesting some alterations to the compromise version I suggested which has addressed the concerns of several people here.

In hindsight, I should have left the PR until after I got the Stoneman book, but I didn't think I'd get much from it (Stoneman has a COI in that he was the head of the Irish Film Board at the time and essentially greenlit the film). Used carefully, however, it's been a real goldmine of production information. I'm still working my way through it, but I don't think there'll be too much else to add other than fine detail; he does tackle the 18 specific points of contention from the petition, but I'll probably err on the side of caution and leave that for the existing sources, which have a little more distance from the subject. Of course, I won't take it to FAC without consulting on its talk page first.

The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.\n",

That is the name I always hear people use - Almaty. The Russians, however, still call it Alma-Ata. For example, I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile, and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty. All the people I met in Almaty, however, say Almaty.

There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a \"\"K\"\"  - including Wikipedia.

Your proposed addition is mostly okay, and gives a good treatment to the question of how the word \"\"terrorist\"\" is applied to the organization.  I would add the FBI website, and the fact that it was one of the organizations on the FBI's terrorism task force watch list.  There are plenty of categories, too many probably, available to help direct readers interested in the topic of terrorism to this article.  Category:Terrorism in America is one of them; the one you just added (:Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the U.S. government) is another.  There is a huge BLP concern with branding living ex members as terrorists, particularly unconvicted ones who deny the charge.  But again, this can all be handled by being cautious about what is said and how it is said.

It is about a holistic approach to health care using natural therapies primarily (joint manipulation, soft tissue manipulation exercise, nutritional counseling, medical acupuncturestress management, health promotion, ergonomic consulting, etc.  To insinuate that the existence of the profession depends on subluxations is a dated, narrowed view of Contemporary Chiropractic.\n",

      "The Bible in Matthew says to put your light on the top of the basket, not under it.  The foundation of notability is identifiability, which I think the congregation at KUC, insisting that they are not a building, is successfully obfuscating by having no pictures of the building on their website.  To quantify this statement, it took me eight full man hours to find KUC on a Google satellite map.  It was easy enough to locate the intersection, but looking at [the picture] on Google, there is no reason to suspect that the building in the distance is the church.  Zeroing in on the actual location was finally accomplished by finding a picture of the church on the web site of the architects of the church, and comparing this street view with the aerial view available from Google.  (Of course, by the liberal definition, I still haven't found the church on Google, because the church is not a building.  If this is your personal view, then you need to consider that this congregation is not currently WP:N notable.)  So assuming that the congregation feels righteous and will not help in identifying their we-are-not-a-building building, I'd suggest that the first thing you could do to improve the notability of KUC is to work on its identifiability: (1) get the maps specifically including Google improved, i.e., get the Google place marker on the building instead of in the middle of the street intersection, (2) does the church have a street address, (3) make your own web site with pictures of the building identifying the building as owned by KUC.  Include pictures of the view toward the surrounding area, such as showing where people park on Sunday morning, the Kippax Fair, and the \"\"adjacent park\"\" where the Christmas Day 2005 services were held. Is the maximum seating capacity of the sanctuary recorded by the fire department?  If there is a sign posted to that effect, the sign could be photographed.\n",

      "Assuming you have access to local libraries and local newspaper archives that go back to 1969 that would include articles about the previous names for the church, you should be able to find additional articles that are not available on the internet so as to satisfy WP:GNG.  You could report these references on your new web site.\n",

      "I think the AfD problem here is that people are questioning churches on the definition of notability in WP:N, \"\"worthy of notice\"\" without being able to articulate or quantify their objection.  Note the argument in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Birchcliff Bluffs United Church that the church there was WP:RUNOFTHEMILL.  The argument is bogus, because the closest example in the essay is a bank that has been in the news five times in 30 years because of being robbed, whereas the church in question could be expected to have mentions, or more, in 500 articles in the last 90 years.  But I think the attitude is real.    \"\n",

      "Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an \"\"article\"\") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing \"\"editorials\"\" and \"\"news articles\"\" as different types of \"\"articles\"\".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.  In the meantime, I have asked for the opinion of other editors.  Hope we can all agree! Best wishes, and thanks for all your good work on this article.   \"\n",

The guy who's never fought, let alone beat a decent fighter besides Gonzales, who Jones totally shut out. That makes allot of sense. Regardless. Bernard Hopkins won a light heavyweight title and that's the bottom line. He was the first Middleweight in history to jump to the light heavyweight division and win A title in 1 fight. Something Ray Robinson failed to do. That's a fact and should be included in this biography. Erdei and the lineal title is a JOKE. What good is the stupid title if none of these guys have to defend it against decent competition? You can't hide behind a lame WBO title fighting nobodies and tomato cans and expect to be considered champion. Erdei is a disgrace and so was Michalczewski. That's why Jones embarrassed the guy who beat him.\n",

Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here.

This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, \"\"base tan\"\"), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). \n",

Is propaganda not \"\"a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?\"\". That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as \"\"presenting one side of an argument\"\" to \"\"influence the attitude of the community\"\"? Or, is it that, as you say, I just \"\"don't understand propaganda\"\"? \n",

If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of \"\"good business\"\" - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o\n",

Read \"\"The theory that prenatally established brain and CNS   structures determine innate gender feelings and gender identity.\"\"  \"\"It appears that if those brain and CNS structures are masculinized   in early pregnancy by hormones in the fetus, then the child will   have male percepts and a male gender identity, independent of   whether the genes or genitalia are male. If those structures   are not masculinized in early pregnancy, the child will have   a female percepts and a female gender identity, again independent   of the genes or genitalia.

Homosexual males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women.  A homosexual transsexual is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female.  While non-homosexual transsexuals, if I understood correctly, also have cross gender structures in their brains, just not the same as a homosexual transsexuals.  The non-homosexual MTF transsexual brains retaining more masculine brain structure.  That is the crux of the problem isn't it now.

While Wheless' ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points.  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE (a space of only 39 years) then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was \"\"as the Gospel and all the elders testify\"\"?

The fact of the matter is that your \"\"nowhere\"\" claim is simply false.  \"\"Where\"\" must be and is assessed on an article by article basis.  In this case the civilian deaths consequent to Harris' policy is a non-trivial issue with respect to Harris and his legacy.  You state here that Harris' policy should be disagreed with on the basis of targets being too strongly defended etc, ie without reference to the issue of civilian casualties.  The fact of the matter is that there IS an issue.  WP:NPOV means a full and frank presentation, not a whitewash.  I should think that such a presentation should be possible without the WP:CENSORship you demand.  I've already tried to accommodate your concerns with respect to the prominence this is given, but I take it you are unwilling to entertain any compromise.  I would invite you to consult Wikipedia:Assume good faith and consider the possibility that I am interested in making Wikipedia more informative and encyclopedic as opposed to \"\"dirty\"\"ing anyone.  \"\n",

He was somewhat of a land speculator, and he very nearly owned Prince George. He tried to buy the land right out from under the GTP's nose, as they were footdragging, as they often did.

There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it.

Perhaps what I'm trying to ask is more of a common-sense question to which the answer is so obvious that no one has thought to incorporate it in a policy or guideline here.  Trying again, \"\"Once an accused criminal is convicted in a court of law, is it not both inappropriate and biased to insist on using the word 'alleged' when writing about the charges of which he's been convicted?\"\"  Maybe someone has a pointer to an old discussion or arbitration about this?  It seems that it must have come up in the past.   \n",

However, there has been many discussions of this sort on individual article pages involving criminals. But, most of these discussions have been initiated by either anonymous users or users who contribute very little to Wikipedia besides the article in question.  Perhaps your best bet would to start there unless someone else can provide you with something more informative.\n",

      "Anyhow, I don't believe this needs to be incorporated into policy/guideline beyond how the word has already been treated.

Regarding the article, I have seen similar language used in many other wikipedia articles and so do not see why mine is such a huge problem. Since it was an edit to the first line, I don't think it would be appropriate to add more to that part of the article, as the logic behind the article is already within the rest of the article (record sales, changes. etc.) and it would look strange to discuss record sales and etc in the first line of the article, right? Anyway, since you wish for references anyway, I will do so immediately. may i please know how to add references to an article? i cannot find the ref toolbar mentioned here anywhere in the page! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/3\n",
      "but I would also appreciate if you could encourage altaf to not continue making personal attacks against me, as it makes me feel highly unwelcome on this site. I say \"\"personal attacks\"\" as his behaviour towards me in not appropriate. It is harassment, since I actually messaged him politely about the change i made (which I am not even supposed to do, since wikipedia is not his property) and if he found a problem, he could have likewise messaged me back instead of running to an editor with yet another complaint about me. I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not. I am open to anyone explaining how I can imp[rove my edits, but I am not open to being treated like a criminal - by this exact same one user - for every word I ever type on the site. Please note that my edits were made in good faith and that I have written nothing malicious.

Though a high diversity of African mtDNA lineages have been detected, few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in Europe to form monophyletic clusters. Malyarchuk et al 2005 detected only two monophyletic clusters, L1b and L3b, in Russians with an estimated age no greater than 6,500 years. Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain. \n",

The pinhole camera starts with a enclosed container (AKA the \"\"dark room\"\") with a very small opening to let in the light. It is therefore a camera obscura. Cameras that use an actual pinhole size aperture are used to expose photographic film or paper but have limited use as viewing or drawing devices because the light that the pinhole admits is very dim and the image would be very hard to see. Most camera obscuras are made with lenses in the aperture since this makes the image much brighter and sharper. Room sized camera obscuras are sometimes made with lensless apertures but these openings are much larger than a pinhole. We have been told that an opening about the size of a US quarter can work well in some rooms. \n",

I nominated this for deletion not because I doubted the accuracy or verifiability of the information contained but because I doubted the subject's notability. Wikipedia has strict guidelines with respect to whether a living person is notable enough to pass our notability requirements, and one of those guidelines requires in-depth coverage of the person in multiple reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject. So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they're affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn't related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements.

This would concern a nuclear reaction of two nitrogen atoms forming a carbon and an oxygen atom, with release of energy. This energy would heat up the remaining nitrogen enough to keep the reaction going until all nitrogen were finished. This was, however, quickly shown to be unlikely enough to be considered impossible . Nevertheless, the notion has persisted as a rumor for many years.\n",

The problem is not that FUNK and GRUNK are obscure acronyms (that could be dealt with by explanation), but that they were bogus (largely non-existent in fact) organisations, created to keep Sihanouk happy and create a facade of respectibility for the Khmer Rouge for the benefit of gullible foreigners (like me at the time). The reality was that the communist Khmer Rouge leadership ran the whole operation, as they showed at once when they came to power. Because Ruy Lopez is a communist and an apologist for the Khmer Rouge, he seeks to impose a completely false view of these organisations on the article. Presumably if he wrote articles on FUNK and GRUNK he would do the same thing there, thus creating yet more revert wars.

      "Born John Webb, John Silas Wilson A.K.A. “BIG HITZ” was born in Chicago Illinois along with eight siblings. Problems in the household ended or so it would seem with his mother losing the rights to all nine of her children. “BIG HITZ” then lived in foster homes, orphanages, and group homes for about five years before a family he was staying with took him in. “BIG HITZ”, 13 at the time was happy but his new family loved government money more than they loved him and when it came to his music “Hip Hop-Rap”, the family that took him in didn’t want him listening to “Hip Hop-Rap” or writing it. But “BIG HITZ” had his first taste of “Hip Hop-Rap” by listening to a rap group called Bone Thugs N Harmony and later, another rapper named Nas. “Big Hitz” had been writing since the early age of 13, and by the time he was 14 years old, he took his first step into a studio to do his first song called “ I represent”. Having a “Hard Knock Life” and hitting a rock bottom couldn’t stop “BIG HITZ” from writing and pursuing the American dream. Through writing and doing music, he found sanity in all of the madness that was going on in his life. At the age of 19, “BIG HITZ” moved in with a friend from High school and formed a group called “BASS & TREBLE” After successfully putting together a Record called “ THE BASS & TREBLE 7 HITZ ep. “BIG HITZ” had a huge sense of accomplishment but the Record went nowhere. After splitting with his friend and partner, “BIG HITZ” set out to build a strong solo career. After recording a solid demo and song catalog, “BIG HITZ” decided to move from Michigan to California.living in michigan brings you to present day. Written By Gisele S. Uwitonze'Bold text'\n",

I laugh in the face of those who call themselves unbiased, and your 'wiki' pompousness. Grow some self awareness. Or at least, a bearable level of cynicism. Christian1985's attitude to the Mail is far, far from unbiased. I've read his additions, deletions, comments carefully. In addition, the fact that numerous calls for a controversy area have been silenced is far from unbiased. The fact is, without a controversy section, an article about a controversial paper is not complete. Christian1985's lack of acceptance that a controversy section may be necessary suggests a frightening bias and narrow-mindedness that distinguishes his contribution to the page and, dear Collect, goes AGAINST the very ethos of wiki that you suggest. 81.104.38.217\n",

We are currently looking over all of the GAs passed before August 2007 and determining if they still meet the criteria. After beginning with 2,808 articles we are now down to less than 900. Last month we had rapid progress, clearing over 300 articles. You've done a great job with the GA process, and with your contributions to so many GANs, I believe you would be a great reviewer for Sweeps. We are trying to complete the process in the next few months, and the best way to meet that goal is to have as many experienced reviewers as possible. I've given up reviewing GANs until this process is over, but you are under no obligation to do so. If you're interested in reviewing some articles, even if its only a few, it would be greatly appreciated. Instructions can be seen here. If you have any questions, let me know. Happy editing!

Any unscientific claims by Pettifer or authors referring to him in their books' bibliographies are excluded. So far the problem is identified with Pettifer, so we put him aside and treat him and the authors pointing at him separately. To the Greek editors here, please use your own state archives to find where the Kolekas live in Greece and when did they live there. Or find their properties there, or some house, a single grave, a single piece of paper written in Greek by anyone of them. Or find when did they last leave from Greece please, or how many were/are they. I want to know. Find some church records (in Albania or Greece), get some proof so you can save face and make me shut up. How difficult can it be to find something Greek in this important man? How come all his children never left any Greek notes somewhere or are not part of some Greek facebook group? How come Spiro's daughter writes poetry books and articles in Albanian and not  single one in modern Greek language? Is this family really ashamed to be Greek or is it just (*drumroll*) not greek!

There is some useful information in what you posted, some of which wasn't really covered in the article, but it would be much better for you to look through the section you edited, and see where individual points you wrote about would best go.

      "To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.\n",

I know the songs by Kylie that I made have not charted, won an award, or have been covered by any artists as stated by WP:NSONGS, there are a selection of songs I found on Wikipedia by really famous artists that kinda sits on the same boat as these articles. For example, articles Superpower (song), Rocket (Beyoncé song) and Rocket (Beyoncé song) by American singer Beyonce are well cover just like my articles but have not charted, won an award or have been covered by a variety of artists as stated by the criteria (maybe the music video significance allows it on the site?), alongside Who Am I Living For? by American singer Katy Perry. Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like \"\"Too Far\"\" and \"\"I Don't Need Anyone\"\" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single. Also, the WP:NSONGS does say that those three criterias do not have to been needed but are afromented to. I'm not trying to make excuses, that is not my intention, but maybe you can help me out on this factor so I can have a clearer idea and mind on what I can do and cannot do with song/album articles. That would be much appreciated )  (talk · contribs} \"\n",

      "Deitcher, David\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"Loran wrote his two article after Lichtenstein's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles, which included the artist's life-sized versions of images from Loran's book.\"\"\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"Portrait of Madame Cézanne and Femme au Chapeau, both of 1962, were among the first paintings in which Lichtenstein based an image directly on a picture by an illustrious predecessor, introducing the theme of art about art. Both are presented at two removes from the original. Cézanne's portrait of his wife is transposed, with significant but subtle alterations, from a diagram book, Cézanne Composition, published a quarter of a century earlier, Lichtenstein was amused by the oversimplified and paradoxical idea that a flat diagram consisting solely of thick black outline could be used to represent the Frenchmen's work, given Cézanne's insistence on eliminating contours from his paintings as incapable of suggesting the corporeal reality of the three-dimensional motif from which he was working.\"\"\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"The contradictory character of the Pop object was central to an unusually lively and revealing debate late in 1963. It was Lichtenstein's earliest Pop paintings that provoked this controversy which led critic Brian O'Doherty (also an artist, under the name Patric Ireland) to identify completely new class of object: the 'handmade readymade.' Reviewing the artist's second Pop show in the New York Times, O'Doherty labeled him 'one of the worst artists in America.' Nonetheless, he also credited him with creating paintings that 'raised some of the most difficult problems in art.' O'Doherty took note of an argument that had just erupted in the art press: the September issues both of Art News and Artforum had run angry features about Pop art in general and Lichtenstein's work in particular.\"\"\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"...Erle Loran, who had targeted two paintings by Lichtenstein, Portrait of Mme. Cézanne and Man with Folded Arms (both 1962), in order to excoriate some of the salient features of the new art. Each painting was a characteristically brazen blowup of a diagram from Loran's book Cézanne Composition, then twenty years old.\"\"\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"Both Loran and O'Doherty thought it absurd that so many supporters of Pop were defending Lichtenstein by insisting that he 'transformed' rather than 'copied' his sources. Claiming that only an expert could discern the difference, O'Doherty found this hairsplitting quite beside the point. After all, it had been possible to classify direct appropriation as art since 1913, when that 'old master of innovation ,' Duchamp had 'started it all by setting up his readymades...and calling them art, leaving on us the burden of proof that they were not.' Both Loran and O'Doherty found the transformation alibi doubly annoying since it clinched the matter of Pop's high-cultural status by resorting to an altogether academic and contradictory dual defense. On one hand, Pop was art because it 'put a frame of consciousness around a major part of American life...we take for granted.' On the other, Pop was art because an artist like Lichtenstein transformed his sources 'like a good artist should'—a clichéd view of fine-art production.\"\"\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"For Loran, the 'transformation' or 'copy' debate was spurious: since the Abstract Expressionists had ventured 'far beyond the process of transforming nature' to produce paintings that presupposed 'no conscious source but have an identity and imagery that is autonomous,' transformation—even were it detectable in Lichtenstien's art— could only constitute aesthetic regression.\"\"\n",
      "(Deitcher, David. \"\"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist\"\".) \"\"For different reasons, Lichtenstein himself shunned the transformation defense.\"\"\n",
      "Coplans, ed.\n",
      "(Coplans, ed.) \"\"The idea of using a closely linked subject matter within a unified style of treatment is obviously suggested in the various paintings deriving from modern masters. Man with Folded Arms and Portrait of Madame Cézanne (both 1962) are quotations of outline diagrams by Erle Loran explaining Cézanne's compositional methods and are similar in the linear black-and-white handling of the imagery.\"\"\n",

This article is being expanded with material for the first time in years and it'd be easier to keep it separate while its being improved. Clearly the LaRouche movment includes many discrete organizations, many of which have overlapping personnel and aims, and some of which are notable enough on their own for articles. For example, the U.S. Labor Party probably deserves an article because every little political party gets an article. OTOH, the National Democratic Policy Committee, while in some ways equally important, probably doesn't merit an article and should be covered in one of the other LaRouche articles. Most of the PACs or campaign comittees are covered in the presidental campaign articles, but thousands of other candidates also ran under  LaRouche-affilitiated groups.

      "Thanks Flyer22 that was not my guess.  Here's what the NBC website says, the official site, not a message board: Lucas was injured when a beam fell on his legs and EJ agreed to save Lucas only if Sami agrees to let EJ have his way with her. Sami reluctantly had sex with EJ and helped him escape to Mexico, after he was wanted in connection with the shooting of John Black. Despite Sami’s attempt to turn over a new leaf, EJ returned and pressed her for information on police activities, and she was pulled into another web of deception, trying to prevent him from learning she was pregnant. That's from Sami Brady.  That tells me the show's official position is that she agreed.  What a character says and what the show's position is in this case are not the same.  Since Ed Scott took over, only Lucas has used the word and Sami and EJ have shared a couple of kisses as well as reading the Santo and Colleen letters together. It has been indicated they are going to \"\"tighten things up\"\" and fill in some wholes. The anticipation by some fans (I know, there's that \"\"some\"\" word but that is the case with people I have encountered) is that the December 29th issue will be resolved soon.   \"\n",

However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). \n",

      "The only thing that was a bit thick was my prose.  The old criticism is that if the pedigree were true, then two children of AEthelred II would be marrying two descendants of AEthelric, the first one generation down, the second 4 generations down.  Hart basically rejected this as absurd on its face, that you could have such a 3 generation difference - Edward marrying his brother-in-law's great-grandniece. Kelley argues that Edward was a generation younger than his half-sister, so the three generation difference becomes two.  Eadric at 40 could have married a 18-year old daughter of AEthelred, meaning the generation difference is now only 1.  Edward could have married an Eadgyth a half-generation or more younger than he was, and Eadric could have been a half-generation younger than his brother AEthelmaer, completely removing the chronological problem.  He was basically saying that, as ridiculous as the difference in generations appears on first glance, it is not as unlikely as it might seem. \n",
      " As to why he is explaining away the AEthelric pedigree, one of the earlier authors had accepted the descend from Wulfric to AEthelmaer, and then suggested that Florence (recte John) had been confused between two AEthelmaers, and that Eadric was not brother of AEthelmaer the Stout.  Kelley is simply saying that this need not be the case, that Eadric could have been brother of AEthelmaer the Stout, that the siblings shown by John of W could all be the children of AEthelweard.  He suggests three possible explanations: A) that one pedigree showing Godwin son of Wulfnoth son of AEthelmaer was mistakenly or fraudulently linked into a second that showed Eadric Streona as son of AEthelric, B) there was an mistaken exchanging two names, such that the authentic pedigree originally showed Eadric, AEthelmaer and an AEthelric as sons of AEthelweard, and somewhere along the lines this was transposed as Eadric, AEthelmaer and AEthelweard as children of AEthelric, or C) that the authentic original pedigree showed the same brothers as sons of AEthel-weard, son of Ead-ric, and a mistaken contraction of these two generations resulted in them simply becoming AEthel-ric. Kelley favors explanation B.\n",

This makes the group shot unquestionably the alternate cover, even if it is more common/recent. The same goes for albums like Light a Fire and Yesterday and Today. So no matter whether we can assert/prove which version is more common, it is blatantly obvious which cover is the \"\"alternate\"\". Indeed, the controversy caused by the original cover, and the subsequent switch to the alternate, is the entire subject of the article's commentary.

Connor's introduction felt ... crappy. Wesley's been introduced in the wrong way - don't jump him into a new role and backtrack characterization, do a Giles where you see him maybe two panels at a time and flesh him out through his own internal monologue. Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided \"\"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!\"\" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).\n",

Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people.

BR is well aware and can vouch for me that I have a secret-admirer/stalker/impostor out there who would actually stalk and harass those editor(s) who harass me while imposting as me, what I'm doing is nothing less than trying to deflect that from the Indian boy should he carry on with harassing me and then getting that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor to latch on his tail instead. Yes, I may have been a wee bit mad at that moment when I commented to him but I'm not stupid. Him, on the other hand, is just plain stupid for going down that path until eventually that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor reacts to him. What are we to do then? Lastly, the Indian boy had actually picked a very convenient date (end of our one month mutual interaction ban) to revert my edit so I'm fully entitled to be mad at him for being an moronic/insensitive jerk, especially at the condescending tone in his edit summary during that particular revert. Tell me now, does it take two hands or one to clap? In honour of that interaction ban, I've stayed away from him for one whole month (to the letter and the spirit of the law that requires of me but he did so only to the letter) and yet at the end of it, he has the galls to come pick on my edit? Come on, how oxymoron can that be that he is indeed trolling by all account? And both times, he goes to ANI, he doesn't have the courtesy to post an ANI-notice on my page, tell me now if that is not trolling? Forgetting twice? How convenient for an excuse, the nerve of this boy.  ♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫® \"\n",

      "It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a \"\"good\"\" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.\n",

Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress \"\"sleazy\"\", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing \"\"accurate\"\" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.\n",

For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too.
